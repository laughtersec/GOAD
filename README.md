**GOAD (v3)**

:bookmark: Documentation : [https://orange-cyberdefense.github.io/GOAD/](https://orange-cyberdefense.github.io/GOAD/)

# WSL issues I faced
- VMs in VirtualBox are slow and stutter, which possibly causes the playbook to timeout when using winrm when connecting to some VMs (dc03 and srv03 in GOAD never timeout)
- Some solutions here: https://github.com/Orange-Cyberdefense/GOAD/issues/72. I applied the changes to globalsettings.ini and workspace/your-instance/inventory_disable_vagrant.
- Sometimes the wrong IP will be assigned to the VM, so delete all files of that VM from VirtualBox and install via goad.sh again.

## Solution
- Use VMware, set the network adapters manually. Works like a charm.
- Make sure you DON'T clone the repo on the UNIX filesystem. Clone it on your Windows NTFS drive, otherwise the VMX files of your VMs won't open in VMware.

## Description
GOAD is a pentest active directory LAB project.
The purpose of this lab is to give pentesters a vulnerable Active directory environment ready to use to practice usual attack techniques.

> [!CAUTION]
> This lab is extremely vulnerable, do not reuse recipe to build your environment and do not deploy this environment on internet without isolation (this is a recommendation, use it as your own risk).<br>
> This repository was build for pentest practice.

## Licenses
This lab use free Windows VM only (180 days). After that delay enter a license on each server or rebuild all the lab (may be it's time for an update ;))
